# Psycholinguistic: Hands-on R project on inflectional morphology complexity
### A quantitative analysis of the morphological complexity using French verbal system data
Repository for the assignment for the Computational Psyicholinguistics course at Università di Pisa (prof. Claudia Marzi, Vito Pirrelli, Marcello Ferro), that contains the notebook with R code used for the quantitative analysis of the morphological complexity of the verbal french system, as reported in the assignment paper. The dataset for this notebook can be found as well in the repo.

As claimed by Marzi, Pirrelli and Ferro, quantitatively assessing the comparative complexity of inflectional systems across languages is an hard task, because of typological diversity. 
The processing-oriented approach I reproposed consists in the training of a Temporal Self- Organizing Map (TSOM, a recurrent variant of Kohonen’s Self-Organizing Maps) , on a set of top-frequency French verb forms, with no added information about the morphosemantic and morphosyntactic content conveyed by the forms, and assessing the behaviour of the network after the training, discussing in conclusion howmorphological inflection can be seen as "a collective, emergent system, whose global self-organization rests on a surprisingly small handful of language-independent principles of word coactivation and competition"
