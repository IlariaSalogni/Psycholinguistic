Repository where the assignment for the Computational Psyicholinguistics course at Universit√† di Pisa (prof. Claudia Marzi, Vito Pirrelli, Marcello Ferro), that contains the notebook with R code used for the quantitative analysis of the morphological complexity of the verbal french system, as reported in the assignment paper.
